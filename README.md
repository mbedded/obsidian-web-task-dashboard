# Web Task Dashboard

**Web Task Dashboard lists tasks in Obsidian, enabling effortless task management without any context switching.**

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to show tasks from third-party services within your current environment.
The official documentation can be found here: https://mbedded.github.io/obsidian-web-task-dashboard/

The dashboard looks like this:
